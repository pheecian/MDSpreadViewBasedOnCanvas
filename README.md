MDSpreadViewBasedOnCanvas
=================

Purpose
-------

`MDSpreadView` is a rewrite of `UIKit`'s `UITableView` that allows for the display
of columns and column headers as well as rows. This repository serves to 
demonstrate and test the `MDSpreadView` class. Please visit the
[MDSpreadView](https://github.com/mochidev/MDSpreadView) repository for the 
actual code :)

Installation
------------

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mochidev/MDSpreadViewDemo --recursive
```

To include it into your projects either download the
[source](https://github.com/mochidev/MDSpreadView), or run the following
on your git repo:

```bash
$ cd <your_repo>
$ git submodule add git@github.com:mochidev/MDSpreadView.git <local_subpath>/MDSpreadView
```

This will allow you to update it at anytime by running `$ git submodule update`.

Usage
-----

Simply add the
[MDSpreadView](https://github.com/mochidev/MDSpreadView) submodule to
your project, add `#import "MDSpreadViewClasses.h"` to the top of the files you 
wish to use `MDSpreadView` in, and set the `delegate` and `dataSource` properties
of your `MDSpreadView` instance to one of your objects, much like you would do 
for a `UITableView`.

Then, implement the datasource and delegate methods demonstrated in `MDViewController.m`.

Don't forget to add `QuartzCore.framework` to your project!

Notes
-----

 - An `MDSpreadViewCell` is created just like a `UITableViewCell` is -- try to 
 dequeue it from the spread view, otherwise create a new one, then 
 configure and return.
 - The table headers are also made of cells, and are loaded just like 
 MDTableViewCells are.
 - Works flawlessly with ~500 billion data points (anything bigger makes `- reloadData` hang).
 - The bigger the cells, the faster it scrolls, since less are onscreen at a 
 time (especially on older hardware).
   - ~150 cells gives 60 fps on current hardware, though you can viably push to 600 cells for ~25 fps
 - `MDSpreadView` uses `MDIndexPath`s *instead* of `NSIndexPath` to index cells.
 - Not all APIs are fully implemented yet, and are there for future reference only.
 - `MDSpreadView` also offers an easier way to make cells via `- spreadView:title...`
 and `- spreadView:objectValue...` datasource methods. The cell classes used can be
 changed via the `default...CellClass` quartet of properties.
 - `MDSpreadView` also has support for footer columns and rows.
 - Unlike UITableView, MDSpreadView is not adversely affected by custom cell sizes.

To Do
-----

 - Programatic scrolling
 - Info Querying
 - Copy-Paste menu support
 - Cell insertion, deletion, and reload
 - Class registration per identifier
 - Better animation between data set transitions
